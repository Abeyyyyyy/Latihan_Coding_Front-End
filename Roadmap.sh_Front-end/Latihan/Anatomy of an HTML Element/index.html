    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph demonstrating basic HTML elements.</p>

    <!-- Practice Activity 2: Nesting Practice -->
    <p>In this paragraph, I have made <strong>this word bold</strong> and <em>this word emphasized</em> to show nesting.</p>

    <!-- Practice Activity 3: Identify and Correct Errors -->
    <!-- Original snippet with errors:
    <h1>Welcome to my Website
    <p>This is a paragraph. <strong>This word should be bold.</p>
    -->
    <!-- Corrected version: -->
    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph. <strong>This word should be bold.</strong></p>

    <!-- Practice Activity 4: Experiment -->
    <!-- Intentionally removing a closing tag from the next paragraph to demonstrate -->
    <p>This paragraph has a missing closing tag for the strong element: <strong>This is bold</p>
    <!-- Note: In a real browser, this might cause rendering issues, but the page still loads. -->
